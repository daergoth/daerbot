# DaerBot

A simple Discord Bot developed for fun

_This bot is only a fun project to learn JS, there are no promises that it will be even remotely functional._

## For more information check:  [https://daergoth.github.io/daerbot/](https://daergoth.github.io/daerbot/)

## Install & Run

You will have to set `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable with your Discord Bot token.  

Also if you plan to run the bot on Heroku, you should set the `HEROKU_ENV` environment variable, too.

After that:

```
npm install 

npm start
```
If the `I am ready` message shows up on the console the bot is up and running!
