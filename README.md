# DaerBot

A simple Discord Bot developed for fun

_This bot is only a fun project to learn JS, there are no promises that it will be even remotely functional._

## For more information check:  [https://daergoth.github.io/daerbot/](https://daergoth.github.io/daerbot/)

## Install & Run
```
npm install 

npm start
```
If the `I am ready` message shows up on the console the bot is up and running!
